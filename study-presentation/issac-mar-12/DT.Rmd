# Introduction to CART

* One of the oldest and simplest ML algorithms.

* Idea: split the feature space into **exhaustive and mutually exclusive** segments under some rules.

# Advantage vs. Disadvantage

.pull-left[

Advantage

* Easy to explain to people.

* People believe that DT mirror human decision making than regression.

* Easy to handle categorical data without doing dummy coding.

* Insensitive to monotone transformation of inputs

* Robust to outliers

]
.pull-right[

Disadvantage

* Level of predictive accuracy is lower than other models

* Trees can be very non-robust. Small changes in the data can cause a large change in the final output.

# Prediction via stratification of the feature space

* Divide the predictior spaces into $J$ distinct and non-overlapping regions, $R_1, ..., R_J$ 

* Goal: find $R_1, ..., R_J$ that minimize the RSS

$$\sum_{j=1}^{J}\sum_{i\in R_{j}}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{j}}\right)^{2}$$
---
# Let's be `greedy`!

There are infinite number of splitting partitions.

* top-down, greedy approach; a.k.a. recursive binary splitting.

* For the predictor $X_j$, define

  * $R_1(j, s) = \{X|X_j \leq s\}$ and $R_2(j, s) = \{X|X_j > s\}$

* For $j$ and $s$, find the value of $j$ and $s$

$$\sum_{i:x_{i}\in R_{1}\left(j,s\right)}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{1}}\right)^{2}+\sum_{i:x_{i}\in R_{2}\left(j,s\right)}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{2}}\right)^{2}$$

We have our data model

$$y_i = x_i^2 + e_i$$

where $e_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 10^2)$


Do we want this?

* No. These lines are too much fitted to the points.

* This model is `overfitted` to the data.

# Build a tree with threshold

1. Build tree until the decrease in the RSS due to each split exceeds some threshold

  * will result smaller trees

  * short sighted trees..

2. Grow a very large tree $T$ first and cut (`prune`) the branches to make a subtree $T_0$

  * how to `prune` tho?

---
# Cost complexity pruning

For each value of $\alpha$, a tunning parameter, there is a subtree which minimizes
  
$$\sum_{m=1}^{\left|T\right|}\sum_{i:x_{i}\in R_{m}}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{R_{m}}\right)^{2}+\alpha\left|T\right|$$  

as small as possible. 

* $|T|$: number of the terminal nodes of the tree $T$

* $R_m$: rectangle corresponding to the $m$th terminal node

* $\hat{y}_{R_m}$ predicted response associated with $R_m$

* $alpha$ can be found using CV.

---
# Classification Trees

Classification tree predict a qualitative response.

* predict the most commonly occurring class

* Given region, 

  * Male : 50
  
  * Female : 100
  
  * Predict the label for the given region as `Female`

---
# How to build?

* We don't have the concept of $RSS$

* Natural alternative to $RSS$ is the `classification error rate`

$$\frac{\text{# of sample} \notin \text{the class label}}{\text{# of toal samples in the given } R}$$
more mathematically,

$$E=1-\underset{k}{max}(\hat{p}_{mk})$$

But, this is not sufficiently sensitive for tree-growing.

# Gini impurity

Measure of `total variance` across the $K$ classes.

G & =\sum_{k=1}^{K}\hat{p}_{k}\left(1-\hat{p}_{k}\right)\\
 & =1-\sum_{k=1}^{K}p_{k}^{2}
\end{align*}$$

* Plot shows the Gini w.r.t. `p` when $K=2$.

* We can easily see that G takes on a small value if all $p_k$ are close to 0 or 1.

# Example
